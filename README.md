geointerest
===========
GoeInterest is a interest based geocaching mobile app, available for any smart phone. Upon login a user selects there top three interests (Surf Spots, Rock & Roll History, and Ramen). The app will then redirect to a map view of a 3 mile radius of the user's current location. The map will then populate with interest markers, indicating fun facts about the users selected interests (i.e. If the user is near Venice Beach, there might be a interest marker that says, "The Doors wrote their first album here).
